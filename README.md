# DataIntegration - Data Science Repository

A comprehensive repository for managing Jupyter notebook code and projects developed during Data Science degree studies. This repository serves as the central hub for organizing coursework, assignments, and projects across multiple data science and AI subjects.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Organize and manage Jupyter notebooks for different Data Science subjects
- Provide templates and best practices for data science projects  
- Serve as a portfolio of academic work and learning progress
- Enable easy collaboration and code sharing
- Support linking to additional subject-specific repositories

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/masocol/DataIntegration.git
cd DataIntegration

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Project Organization

Each subject directory contains:
- `assignments/` - Course assignments and homework
- `projects/` - Larger projects and capstone work
- `resources/` - Additional materials, notes, and references
- `README.md` - Subject-specific documentation

### 3. Using Templates

1. Navigate to `project-templates/`
2. Copy the appropriate template to your project directory
3. Rename and customize based on your needs
4. Follow the structured approach provided

## 📚 Subject Areas

### Core Data Science Subjects
- **Data Integration** - ETL processes, data cleaning, API integration
- **Machine Learning** - Supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation  
- **Statistics** - Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, regression
- **Data Visualization** - Charts, dashboards, interactive visualizations
- **Databases** - SQL, NoSQL, database design and optimization
- **Programming Fundamentals** - Python basics, data structures, algorithms

### Additional Repositories
For managing multiple subjects, consider creating linked repositories:
- `DataScience-Advanced-ML` - Advanced machine learning topics
- `DataScience-AI-Projects` - Artificial intelligence projects
- `DataScience-Capstone` - Final capstone projects
- `DataScience-Research` - Research papers and literature reviews

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

### Core Stack
- **Python 3.8+** - Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning

### Development Tools
- **Git** - Version control
- **Black** - Code formatting
- **Flake8** - Code linting
- **Pytest** - Testing framework

## 📋 Best Practices

### Code Organization
1. Use meaningful file and folder names
2. Include docstrings and comments
3. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
4. Separate data, code, and documentation

### Notebook Management
1. Clear outputs before committing
2. Use markdown cells for documentation
3. Keep notebooks focused and modular
4. Include data source information

### Version Control
1. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
2. Use .gitignore to exclude data files and checkpoints
3. Create branches for experimental work
4. Tag important milestones

## 🔗 Linking Additional Repositories

To manage multiple subject repositories effectively:

### Option 1: Git Submodules
```bash
# Add submodule for advanced ML
git submodule add https://github.com/masocol/DataScience-Advanced-ML.git advanced-ml

# Add submodule for AI projects  
git submodule add https://github.com/masocol/DataScience-AI-Projects.git ai-projects
```

### Option 2: Documentation Links
Maintain a `LINKED_REPOSITORIES.md` file with:
- Repository URLs
- Subject descriptions
- Relationship to main repository
- Cross-references between projects

### Option 3: Project Organization
```
